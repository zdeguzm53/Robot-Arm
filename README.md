# Robot Arm Plan

#### Goal
- Construct an arduino-controlled robot arm from materials in the sigma lab.

#### Resources/Materials
- 4-6 servos
- Arduino
- 9V battery pack
- Gears made out of 3mm acrylic
- 5 mm LEDs
- Switch (for power)
- Potentiometers (for controlling servos) 
- Photo interrupters
- 3D printer and laser cutter

#### Schedule
- *Before winter break*
  - Finish brainstorming and submit detailed plan
- *After winter break ~ solidworks*
  1. Make the base of the arm
     - Box connected by corner tabs
     - Properly dimensioned holes for screws, arduino, led, switch, potentiometers
      - Hinge for one side of the box
  2. Make the strips of acrylic connected by gears
     - These should be relatively simple pieces, they are just put in place to increase the distance between the “joints”       of the assembly
      - They will just have holes to connect them to the other pieces
      - Serve no other significant function
  3. Make the “claw” that picks up the object
     - Each side has gears on one side, when they are connected it makes the claws open and close together when only one         of them is being controlled by the servo
      - The other side has “teeth”
     - The ridges make it less slippery and less likely to drop the object
  4. Make the servo holders 
      - Material surrounding the base of the servo and connects to the acrylic
  5. 3D print holders, laser cut all pieces
  6. Assemble!
